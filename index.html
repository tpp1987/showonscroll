            <h2>What's this all about?</h2>
            <p>This page is a test. I made it because I'm learning JavaScript, and I wanted to try something&nbsp;out.</p>
            <p>Here, you will find a selection of random images from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash.com</a>, laid out in a single&nbsp;column.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of this project is to display a set of social icons at the right of the page when you scroll beyond a certain&nbsp;point. The icons are not actually links.</p>
            <p>I also wanted to learn how to deploy to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. That's&nbsp;it.</p>
